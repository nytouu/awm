# My awesome dotfiles

Those are my awesome dots
If you want to install those you can clone the repo :


# Install


```sh
mv ~/.config/awesome ~/.config/awesome-old #to backup your old config if you have one
git clone https://github.com/nytouu/awm.git ~/.config/awesome
```

Then you will need to compile and generate a liblua_pam.so file if you want to 
use the lockscreen, go to [this repo](https://github.com/RMTT/lua-pam), compile
and replace liblua_pam.so by your own.
